Optimization of crowd evacuation in case of emergency, 2023

Contributors: Carlos Cotta, José E. Gallardo

## Requirements

This project has the following dependencies:

* [ea](https://github.com/Bio4Res/ea): evolutionary algorithm library for optimization
* [json-simple](https://cliftonlabs.github.io/json-simple/): Library for parsing configuration files and dumping statistics.
* [pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton](https://github.com/Bio4Res/pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-cellular-automaton): cellular automaton library for simulating crowd behavior
* [pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-environment](https://github.com/Bio4Res/pedestrian-evacuation-simulator-environment): library for representing an manipulating environments from which evacuation is to be performed
* [statistics](https://github.com/Bio4Res/statistics): library with basic descriptive statistics

Maven users: these dependencies are already included in the <code>pom.xml</code> file
